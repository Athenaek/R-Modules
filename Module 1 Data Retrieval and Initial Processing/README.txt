Hi Nate,

Welcome to your first training. Today we are going to retrieve data from HANA and do some preprocessing, before we save the results as a data frame to a csv file for later use. 

Try and code it yourself in the hana_connector.R file - small parts are done for you, but most if it you have to do on your own (follow the 11 EX steps by coding underneath numbered exercises). I am giving some hints along the way. 
If you can't figure it out, you can consult the hana_connector_answers.R file to help you. Remember there's more than one way to skin a cat - this is just showing you one way of doing it. 

Before start of this exercise, make sure to:
- Request access to HANA
- Install HANA driver
- Configure HANA in ODBC data sources
- Install packages that are being used by running install.packages("<package.name>") in the R console

Next training we'll be exploring the data. Perhaps after that we'll look into modelling the data.
