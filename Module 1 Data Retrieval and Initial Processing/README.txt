Hi Skyler,

Welcome to your second training. In this module we want to learn how to retrieve data from (relational) databases. We will probably be exclusively using HANA and GFSDATA, so let's focus on those. Once we've retrieved some data, we do some preprocessing, before we save the results as a data frame to a csv file for later use. 

Try and code it yourself in the hana_connector.R file - small parts are done for you, but most if it you have to do on your own (follow the 11 EX steps by coding underneath numbered exercises). I am giving some hints along the way. 
If you can't figure it out, you can consult the hana_connector_answers.R file to help you. Remember there's more than one way to skin a cat - this is just showing you one way of doing it. 

Before start of this exercise, make sure to:
- Request access to HANA
- Install HANA driver
- Configure HANA in ODBC data sources
- Install packages that are being used by running install.packages("<package.name>") in the R console

Next training we'll be exploring the data in a bit more detail.
