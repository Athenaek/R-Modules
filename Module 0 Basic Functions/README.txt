Hi Skyler,

Welcome to your first training. In this start-up module, I will show you some of the basic functions R has to offer that I personally use a lot. You may recognize some of them from your online trainings. 

Start with tutorial.R first, in which you don't yet need to code yourself: just read along and try to understand what is going on. 
Then try practice.R where I've set up a few challenging practice exercises with fictitious data. 

In case you can't figure it out, try looking for the answer on stackoverflow. There you'll find numerous solutions to practically all coding questions. 

Next training we'll be looking at retrieving data from a database. 

Good luck!
